<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<p>I've worked as a librarian in university libraries, utilising and adapting to technological developments from the 1990s onwards. Library resources evolved during my experience as a librarian from mainly printed material to a combination of print and online resources. I took a special interest in developing library subject webpages and online enquiry services, using social media to promote user engagement. 
Along with the evolution of resources, I had to develop new IT skills to utilise what was available. As technologies and available hardware/software changed, I would learn to utilise them, and working practices often changed too.
As technology evolves, resources evolve to better suit the needs of users - both for service provider or business and customer or user. User expectations/activities and working practices evolve. I always had a special interest in evolving technologies, particularly internet based resources. I often participated in project groups developing web pages and electronic resources.
I like to learn to do new things and add new skills to my repetoire. As a result I studied drama and acting on a number of part time courses whilst working as a librarian.
<br>
<br>
In 2012-2013 I spent a year studying acting full time on a course that involved performances on stage at a variety of theatres and a final showcase at The Criterion Theatre, London. 
This course included stage and screen acting, musical theatre, movement, dance, voice and stage combat. I passed basic APC qualifications in Unarmed and armed combat , Rapier, Dagger, Gauntlet and Knife combat.
I am registered on Spotlight as an actor and have a self managed website which I created using Wix.
<br> 
<br>
Since I enjoy working on webpages, trouble-shooting and working with a variety of software packages and resources as a librarian and actor I thought I would enjoy further developing my IT skills and experience on the Codenation course.
My experience in libraries has provided me with useful experience of asking questions to clarify what others require, as users don't always articulate their needs accurately. Having worked alongside technical and computer services staff, there is often a disconnect between how non-technical staff and technical staff understand and describe processes. Being able to communicate with and without the jargon are useful for any staff facing customers or users of services who may not be technically minded, but want to be able to use technology in their daily life.
<br>
<br>
I particularly enjoyed the imaginative and creative story creation aspects of creating a game as part of a team during the Codentation course, and the organisation of structure and design elements of building this website.
I would like to understand more about design and plan to keep learning about this in the future. I have a very visual imagination, I would describe as cinematic. I would like to explore using this more in different activities.
