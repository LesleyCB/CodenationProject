<b>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</b>
<br>
IT serves a multitude of purposes in modern business. At a basic level, IT may help business management, and the manufacture/delivery and sale of goods and services.
<br>
IT systems help administratively, enabling storage and management of important business information on clients/users/customers, processes, policies, employees and teams. They help businesses manage the company finances, ensuring suppliers are paid, employees wages are paid, customers receive their goods or services.
<br>
<br>
Standard letter templates can be used with databases of clients for regular/routine purposes, saving time and employee labour.
<br>Communication can be faster between clients/users and businesses who use communication in person, via email/telephone, using internet forms, online meetings etc. Online information can be updated easily and so the online information available should be up to date - printed information can be misleading if printed prior to a change.
<br>Once libraries used card indexes, but now have computer catalogues that can be searched via the internet from home prior to a visit. Circulation information on stock is stored on the catalogue so it inform the user on whether the item is on the shelf or on loan. This saves the user a wasted trip and allows them to place a reservation on the item so they may take it out it when it is returned.
<br>RFID in libraries, has allowed many to run as self service, with self service kiosks replacing issue desks. Return boxes in libraries channel the items to sorting machines that use the RFID system to sort the items ready for shelving, which previously was a manual handling task undertaken by staff.
<br>Developments in IT have changed the way we lead our lives on a daily basis and how businesses are run. 
<br>
In commerce, IT has changed the shopfloor - with scanners, barcodes, RFID type tags commonplace. Electronic commerce has become very popular - particularly in times such as the current year where we have had the COVID virus crisis and lockdown situations. Mobile phone technology, and the use of Apps to promote/enable consumer purchase are also a trend which is important for companies to fully utilise to ensure they survive.
<br>
Information is more readily available now via the internet. Services and information that once would have taken days to receive may be received instantly, or on the same day.
<br>
As technology develops, user and consumer behaviour and expectations change. Businesses need to ensure they are evolving in line with these changes.

<b>1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</b>
<br>
<b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</b>
<br>
<br>
Aside from good IT and coding skills, and knowledge of how to use programmes to deliver projects. other skills you may need are:
<br>
<br>
<b>Good Communication Skills</b> 
Good communication skills are crucial to manage and complete digital projects. You need to ensure you ask enough questions to clarify with the client every part of the project and functionality of the product.
In order to complete digital projects successfully you need to know how the client's business or service is run and what is required from the project - so you can work on providing a product that meets these needs. the relevant IT skills. You need to know what packages, websites or software to use to perform the tasks. You may need to know what coding languages can help you to provide the services/functions required.
You need to have a time scale for the project and regular communication between the client and yourself to ensure there aren't misunderstandings. Understanding what the client wants is crucial. Regular meetings and demos can help the client and yourself tease out any problems - in functionality, look or terminologies applied in language in the front facing product.
You need to have time management skills so you can set deadlines for parts of the project and work towards the overall goal in stages. You may use something as simple as Trello to plot the project and to monitor progress.<br>
<br>
<b>Enquiry skills:</b>
<br>
Asking enough questions to clarify what the project involves and what each stage in the development process is essential. You need to know what the client expects and how they want it to be delivered.
<br><b>Some examples of questions:</b>
<br>Deadline setting questions.
<br>What software/hardware/Apps are used and does this product have to work with?
<br>Is there a corporate look and logo/ethos that you need to ensure the project fits in with?
<br>How does the business or organisation work/how do their processes work - how does this need to be reflected in the project?
<br>What is the level of technical expertise of the users?
<br>Do you need to use particular terminology/make it user friendly? What does the client want you to do and how?
<br>Does this have to be compatible with pcs, laptops, Apple, Windows, Android/iphone/tablets and other devices, Does this have to work within different browswers?
<br>Do they use other Apps/social media?
<br>
<b>Management/Planning of the project:</b>
<br>Ability to break down the project into individual parts and prioritise in the correct order where neccessary. Plan/organise timelines for each part of the project so they are completed and the overall project is completed and delivered on time.
<br>
<b>Attention to detail:</b>
<br>
Attention to every detail ensures you account for anything that might be problematic during development, and that nothing is overlooked.
<br>
<b>Communication Skills:</b>
<br>
If you don't have good communication skills, don't regularly meet up or communicate with the client to monitor progress and check that the product meets the needs and expectations you may deliver a product that is not what the client wanted.
<br>
<b>Time Management Skills:</b>
<br>
If you don't plan and manage your time efficiently you may run behind on tasks and miss the deadline for delivering the finished project/product.
<br>
<b>Regular meetings during the project duration and Regular product Demos with the client:</b>
<br>
If you don't do demonstrations with the client before the finish, you may find there has been a misunderstanding/miscommunication and the product needs more work to get it ready to go live. You may need to change the user interface or look, make it more user friendly, change the terminology used in places that the customer or user sees, for example.
<br>
<b>Regular Team or colleague meetings:</b>
<br>
If you work in a team, miscommunication or lack of regular check-ins to monitor progress or resolve problems can lead to delays or problems with completion.
<br>
<br>
<b>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</b>
<br>
<br>
I waitied until I had the written work task information and structured my webpages accordingly, since that seemed the most logical way to do the task.
<br>I had the main structure of the content/pages decided upon and could then work on the design of the pages using a CSS stylesheet.
<br>I could work on the basic HTML files and start adding content during the process of the week.
<br>Once I had an idea of what the project involved I was able to make a very simple Trello board for my website breaking down pages and content within them so I could move items from To do, across to Doing and Done when I had finished them.
<br>I also put a card in trello to remind me of the individual submission stages to ensure that submission was completed as required - so the card refers to the Github submission, taking screenshots of the website in 2 different browsers and sending the links required/images on Slack to the tutor.

<br>
<br>
<b>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Selecting/Using IT systems and software - considerations:</b>
<br>Is it compatible with the hardware you are using?
<br>Is it fit for the purpose or is there a better product?
<br>Is it easy to use?
<br>Is it compatible with other systems/software/hardware?
<br>Is it free? If not, is it good value and can you afford it or is there an alternative available?
<br>
<br>
<b>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub
help with your codes version control.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Visual Studio code</b>
<br>
Using visual studio code for our course was great as it allowed us to create and use Python, HTML and CSS files/code. It is quite user friendly and with HTML it even anticipates which brackets you are closing and prompts you.
<br>
I was able to create a folder in Visual Studio for the project, individual HTML files for each page, a CSS file for the stylesheet for formatting/design/layout and an image folder with any images I wished to use on my site.
<br>
<b>Slack and Zoom</b>
<br>Communication via online platforms such as Slack helped our Codenation teams to communicate and share ideas, files etc during this course. We were also able to set up and notify each other of zoom meetings so we could work together, screen sharing so we could work on problems collaboratively.
<br>
<b>Trello</b>
<br>
Trello is a good planning and monitoring tool which can be used individually and also in teams. It is a brilliant tool for breaking the project into its constituent parts, and monitor progress until completion. You can add deadlines for each task and add checklists to itemise each part of a task too. Users can attach files and so it is another way to share ideas and files while working on a project.
<br>
The default organisation of columns on Trello is "To do," "Doing" and "Done." You can move the parts independently across the board until completion. It is very user-friendly and the visual nature of the tool is appealing.
<br>
I was able to see the different versions of my files on Trello and when they were attached. This way I could see which were the latest versions and delete older ones.
<br>
<b>Github</b>
<br>
Github similarly, allowed me to see what versions were uploaded at which time, enabling me to delete old files and manage my web project effectively.
It allowed me to create a repository where I could store files for each HTML page, the CSS file and Image folder and upload them. So it provides a good hosting solution for my needs.
<br>
<br>
<b>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</b>
<br>
<p>
GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation relates to personal information/data - both accessing information an organisation holds relating to yourself, and user protection by governing how an organisation uses personal data. 
<br>
GDPR or General Data Protection Regulation is relevant to anyone who works with information, particularly personal data/information of clients/users. GDPR refers to the use of personal information and data and is the current legal requirement. Companies need to be GDPR compliant - and all their practices, use of software, webpages etc need to be compliant.
<br>
Any business (including sole traiders), organisations etc need to comply, and any digital projects or work undertaken need to take GDPR seriously and implement it. If you are not GDPR compliant you may be prosecuted.
<br>
<b>Some of the main issues of GDPR are:</b>
<br>
<b>Data Minimalisation:</b> That companies/organisations should identify and only take/use the minimum amount of information that is required for their purposes.
<br>
<b>Protection of data:</b> Keeping data safe. e.g Security and Confidentiality.
<br>
<b>Accountability:</b> Being accountable to your customers. Since GDPR was introduced there is more information on websites about how information is used - basically companies demonstrating their accountability/transparency.(<b>1</b>)
<br>
<br>
<b>Useful links to GDPR Information:</b>
<br>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation">UK Government website on GDPR
<br>
<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/">Independent Commission Office Guide to GDPR</a> - This website has lots of useful information and toolkits on data protection - for businesses/clients. Go to the main ICO page for information for a range of examples of data useage.
