<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (Review)</h2>
<p><b>Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are successful.</b>
<br>
<b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
<br>
2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
<br></b>
Visual Studio code was an appropriate tool for creating a folder with HTML files, CSS file, and image files for my website. It was quite user friendly.
I could create code for the website in html files. I was able to create a folder with my images in and a CSS file to create a stylesheet to format the pages as I wished.
It also allowed me to use python to work on code to work on creating a text based game.
Trello was a user friendly tool for planning an entire project and breaking it into components so I could monitor progress and see what I had completed and what was outstanding until the project was completed.
Both tools were appropriate for my needs and I shall continue to use them.
Github was also very user friendly and allowed me to upload my files and folders and host my pages. It met the requirements.
Slack and Zoom enabled communication with the tutor and others on the course, for sharing ideas or information and resolving problems.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
of openness. What would you change?
<br>
2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I am relatively happy with the website. My website is rather plain and not very visually interesting. If I spent more time on the look I would perhaps make it more appealing using layers of colour creatively. I used opacity a little but I would like to use images more with opacity for a nice background effect.
<br>I could also improve the layout and the navigation bar, put a back to the top button on each page, and a form for users to contact me on the Contact me page.
<br>I would also add more visual images breaking up the content/text.
<br>Additionally connecting up the page with social media use on linked in or twitter could be a good way of connecting with others.
<br>I could do a lot more research on the issues and the practicalities of working on IT projects as well as the IT elements. 
<br>I could do more research on disability and website design compliance and GDPR - and implement them.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</b>
<br>I have used the guidelines for the outcomes to put the content into these pages - and have added to and reviewed the sections.
<br>I have tried to ensure they meet the requirements.
