<h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h2>
<p>Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems
<br>
<br>
<b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</b>
<br>
<br>I think I could be more efficient with my time in the future, as I have more experience using HTML and CSS and would not need to spend so much time making mistakes and correcting them.
<br>In terms of tools and systems - the tools were fit for purpose. 
<br>I would ensure I had more experience of using the code before I took on a project utilising it in the real world. This was a steep learning curve - but the way the course is designed.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</b>  
<br>
<br>Better time management.
<br>Using Trello to break down the task and put time deadlines on them.
<br>More experience and practice prior to a project.
<br>More research and knowledge about CSS, Flexiboxes and design features prior to a project.
<br>More research on accessibility.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</b>
<br>
<br>If I were working on another webpage project and we were doing it as a team task we would need to agree on the structure/where the content would lie/have agreed templates prior to working individually.
<br>I would plan my time differently - and allow for certain CSS/design elements to take more time.
<br>I would do a more detailed Trello board with deadlines for design and content elements/checklists on the cards.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>It is useful to test digital products/solutions on a variety of PCs, Apple Macs, Tablets, Ipads, Laptops, Iphones and Android phones.
<br>It is useful to test webpages on different browsers too. Online resources/websites may behave differently on a variety of browsers/devices.
<br>This testing should take place while you are developing a project - you should be doing the trouble-shooting throughout so you know if something is not suitable for purpose.
<br>If you have a team, you could divide the testing up - but you should agree on how something should work, so you know when the solution deviates from that/doesn't work.
<br>It is useful to keep screen shots/records of errors/problems in case you can't reproduce them at a later date. So you can work out causes/solutions.
<br>It is useful to test from different locations too, over different networks.
<br>You could also have a focus group at the research and development stage to test the product and feed back any problem areas or anything they would like added or improved.
