<p><b>1.1 Content and Layout for each webpage described:</b>
<br>
<Br>For all pages the background is a light colour with black font - clear and contrasting for easy reading/accessibility. I used a google font called Roboto for its clean unfussy look with accessibility issues in mind.
<br>The main headings are Header 1 (centered) and the subheadings are header 2 (Aligned left). For most of the content text the size of the font is 18 px and is justified.
<br>The weblinks/email links display in the default blue.
<br>I used navigation bar code from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">https://wwww.w3schools.com</a> to create my navigation bar. I chose a black bar as it was a clear contrast with the pale background. I also used this website to work out how to use flexiboxes to organise my layout/content - adapting the code from the examples on there to my needs.
<br>I used a flexcontainer and boxes to create box of colour which the images and text content is situated within (this allowed me to align images left and text alongside on the right of the page, justified), which is close in colour to the main background colour.
<br>I used id for specifying particular formatting for unusual items within the pages (e.g acknowledgements underneath photos) and class when creating the flexcontainer/box/divisions for the content.

<b>1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Copyright Issues and Images:</b>
<br>
Anything you publish in print or online should be your own creation. If you wish to use images, you could create your own. You can take digital photographs and add them to your website - since they are your own creation/proprerty. You should, however, get permission from people who feature in any photographs prior to publication.
<br>
<br>
You may find copyright free images online (e.g creative commons) - but they may have conditions attached. eg education purposes/non-profit purposes. There are different terms on using these - read the information carefully regarding legal terms and conditions on use.
<br>
<br>
It is far better to create your own original images for use on your website. If you want to photograph scenes that include people, you should obtain the individual's prior agreement for them to be used for the purposes of the website. 
<br>
<br>
If you do wish to use someone else's image, you may ask permission from the image creator/owner directly. They may allow you to use an image providing youa dd a statement alongside the image on your website (indicating they are the creator/copyright holder and you are using the image or content with their agreement).
I have an agreement with the photographer who took the photograph that appears on the "Index/About Me" page that I may use the image providing I put an acknowledgement alongside it. When I purchased the headshot for my Spotlight profile, she provided me with a document outlining the terms.
So for any images or content, if it is not your property you should have documentation to prove you have permission to use them. For individuals in photographs, it is best to have a written agreement too.
<br>
<br>
<b>Referencing other peoples' ideas and Plagiarism:</b>
<br>
If you refer to someone else's ideas or words - whether print or online, you should acknowledge the original source. Not doing this is plagiarism. If you have referred to a print source, you should provide information on the publication so the reader knows how to find the original source should they wish to. If it is an online sourse, you may also add a link on your website to the original.
In hard copies of written works you would decide on a referencing system to use and apply the rules to the format of your references and in text citations.
There are different referencing systems you may use. University library websites are a useful source of information on referencing since librarians have to advise students on this for their work.
<br>
<br>
<b>If you are are using online resources the following is an example of a simple way to refer to a source:</b>
<br>A simple way to reference a source is to put a number at the end of the citation or indirect quotation in the text in brackets - and a list of references at the bottom of the page with the corresponding numbers. 
<br>See an example of this on the page for <a href="unit1.html">Unit 1: Outcome 1.</a> 
<br>Towards the bottom of that page there is a number at the end of one of the paragraphs and the corresponding reference with a link to the online article.
<br>
<br>
<b>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</b>
<br>
<br>
Some people may need to use magnifying or screen reading software when using computers if they have problems with their eyesight.
<br>It can be useful to put useful alternative text descriptions where you are using images for this software to read.
<br>It is good practice to make webpages accessible to all users, including dyslexic users when considering colour choices for backgrounds, text fonts and links.
<br>Basic good practice is a high contrast between the background and any text to make it more easy for all to read. Certain font shapes, colours and backgrounds may make reading more harder for dyslexic or colour blind users.
<br>Equality law relates to accessibility for all. Most company or organisations' will have employees who have a disability, so it is a legal requirement to ensure inaccessibility is not an issue, and it is also in their own interests.

<b>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</b>
<br>
<br>
HTML files are appropriate for website creation and CSS files are the appropriate for stylesheets to apply design templates to the html files for websites. JPeg, Png and Gif are examples of image file types that can be used.
